    Action moives/story are mostly targeted towards adults due to most action would involve violance
    which wouldnt be good for childern base on whats the movie/story. Action moives are mostly comes with 
    hero vs a villan since that is the common consecpt where it involves fighting. Another would be mmovies
    that surround it self with fighting in genral but can be some time seen in carrtoon due to the cartoon 
    violance concept were the charater are just getting hurt in dumb ways.
